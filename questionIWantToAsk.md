# Questions I want to ask in this week's workshop
1. Check ex1() is this the best way to do it? Is there a more efficient way? In python you can do [0-5] or something like that to get the first 5 numbers is there something similar in php.
2. Have I done ex3() correctly? Why did we need to use dechex()? I did not use it and it still works.
